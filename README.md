# Tracking app for you life
If you want to see how much time you are spending on tasks and need a tracker for this, this is the app for you.

- First, make a goal with the help of the right bar
- Add a step (or steps) to the goal
- Go to settings on the right side of the goal and submit how much time per week you want to spend
- That's it! Just press the start button and it will automatically calculate the percentages for week and day
- The percentage on the settings of the goal shows the total percentage of the week (all the steps)

  ### Happy tracking! Stay disciplined
